# Search Engine for Wikipedia Dump

This is our final project for the Information Retrieval course at Ben Gurion University. It aims to build a search engine designed specifically to index and retrieve information from a Wikipedia dump.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a search engine capable of efficiently indexing and searching through the extensive information available in the Wikipedia dump. By implementing a range of information retrieval techniques, our objective is to create a robust and effective search engine that delivers relevant results to user queries. 
We aim to optimize various metrics such as MAP@5, F1@30, while minimizing the overall running time to enhance the user experience.

### Features

- Indexing of Wikipedia dump data
- Query processing and retrieval of relevant documents
- Ranking algorithms to prioritize search results
- Performance optimization for efficient searching

### The Repository Contains:

- Scripts for creating indices for the Wikipedia dump's text, title, and anchor list.
- Script for generating PageRank and PageView metrics for the Wikipedia dump files.
- Backend for the search engine to efficiently search through the Wikipedia dump's articles.
- Frontend for the search engine to present users with search results.
