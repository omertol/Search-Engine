# Search Engine for Wikipedia Dump

This is our final project for the Information Retrieval course at Ben Gurion University. It aim to build a search engine specifically designed to index and retrieve information from a Wikipedia dump.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a search engine that can efficiently index and search through the vast amount of information available in the Wikipedia dump. By implementing various information retrieval techniques, we aim to create a robust and effective search engine that provides relevant results to user queries.

### Features

- Indexing of Wikipedia dump data
- Query processing and retrieval of relevant documents
- Ranking algorithms to prioritize search results
- Performance optimization for efficient searching
